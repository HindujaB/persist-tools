## Introduction

This is the specification for the Persist Tools of [Ballerina language](https://ballerina.io/), which supports several operations on the Ballerina Persistence Layer. Ballerina Persistent Layer provides functionality to store and query data conveniently through a data model instead of SQL query language.

The Persist Tools specification has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant GitHub tag.

If you have any feedback or suggestions about the tool, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ballerinalang). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` in GitHub.

The conforming implementation of the specification is released and included in the distribution. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.

## 1. Overview
This specification elaborates on the `Persist CLI Tool` commands.

## 2. Initializing the Bal Project with Persistence Layer

```bash
bal persist add --datastore mysql --module db --test-datastore h2
```

| Command Parameter |                                                         Description                                                          | Mandatory |   Default Value    |
|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:------------------:|
|    --datastore    | used to indicate the preferred database client. Currently, 'mysql', 'mssql', 'google sheets' and 'postgresql' are supported. |    No     |      inmemory      |
|     --module      |                        used to indicate the persist enabled module in which the files are generated.                         |    No     |   <package_name>   |
| --id  |                                                    Used as an identifier                                                     | No | generate-db-client |
| --test-datastore |            used to indicate the preferred database client for testing. Currently, 'h2', 'inmemory' are supported.            | No |         No         |


The command initializes the bal project with the persistence layer. This command includes the following steps,

1. Create persist directory
   This directory should contain the data model definition file. This file will define the required entities as per the [`persist` specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-persist/blob/main/docs/spec/spec.md#2-data-model-definition)
2. Create a model definition file in persist directory
   It will create a file named `model.bal` with required imports(`import ballerina/persist as _;`),  if no files are present in the `persist` directory.
3. Update Ballerina.toml with persist module configurations.
   It will update the Ballerina.toml file with persist configurations.
    ```ballerina
    [[tool.persist]]
    id = "generate-db-client"
    targetModule = "<package_name>.<module_name>"
    options.datastore = "<datastore>"
    options.testDatastore = "<test_datastore>"
    filePath = "persist/model.bal"
   ```

The directory structure will be,
```
medical-center
├── persist
         └── model.bal
├── Ballerina.toml
└── main.bal
```

Behaviour of the `add` command,
- Users should invoke the command within a Ballerina project.
- Users can use optional arguments to indicate the preferred module name and data store; otherwise, default values will be used.
- User can use test-datastore to indicate the preferred database client for testing. Currently, 'h2', 'inmemory' are supported. If specified it will update the Ballerina.toml file with the testDatastore option to generate the test client along with the main client at the build time.
- Users cannot execute the command multiple times within the same project. They need to remove the persist configurations from the Ballerina.toml if they want to reinitialize the project.

Apart from the `bal persist add` command, if you want to use the `bal persist generate` command you can initialize the project with the following `init` command,

```bash
bal persist init
```

This command includes the following steps,

1. Create persist directory:
   Within this directory, a data model definition file should be created. This file will outline the necessary entities according to the [`persist` specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-persist/blob/main/docs/spec/spec.md#2-data-model-definition)
2. Generate a model definition file within the persist directory:
   This action will create a file named model.bal with the requisite imports (import ballerina/persist as _;) if no files currently exist in the persist directory.

## 3. Generating Persistence Derived Types, Clients, and Database Schema

```bash
bal build
```

The `bal build` command will generate [Derived Entity Types and Persist Clients](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-persist/blob/main/docs/spec/spec.md#3-derived-entity-types-and-persist-clients)
as per the `persist` specification and the database schema associated with the data model definition.
Additionally, this command will create(update) `Config.toml` file with configurables used to initialize variables in `persist_db_config.bal`.
```ballerina
[<data model name(definition filename>]
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
user = "root"
password = ""
database = ""
```

It will add generated files under the conventions,
1. If the module name is the same as the package name, it will generate the files under the `default` module.
   ```
   medical-center
   ├── generated
         ├── persist_client.bal
         ├── persist_db_config.bal
         ├── persist_test_client.bal (This file will be generated if the test-datastore is provided)
         ├── persist_test_init.bal (This file will be generated if h2 is provided as the test-datastore)
         ├── persist_types.bal
         └── script.sql
   ├── persist
         └── model.bal
   ├── Ballerina.toml
   ├── Config.toml
   └── main.bal
   ```
2. If the module name is different from the package name, it will generate the files under a new submodule with the same name as the file.
   ```
   medical-center
   ├── generated
        └── medical-item
              ├── persist_client.bal
              ├── persist_db_config.bal
              ├── persist_test_client.bal (This file will be generated if the test-datastore is provided)
              ├── persist_test_init.bal (This file will be generated if h2 is provided as the test-datastore)
              ├── persist_types.bal
              └── script.sql
   ├── persist
        └── model.bal
   ├── Ballerina.toml
   ├── Config.toml
   └── main.bal
   ```

`persist_client.bal` file will contain the client API for the entities defined in the model file.
`persist_db_config.bal` file will contain the configurable variables required for the database access.
 ```ballerina
 import ballerinax/mysql.driver as _;

 configurable int port = ?;
 configurable string host = ?;
 configurable string user = ?;
 configurable string database = ?;
 configurable string password = ?;
```
`persist_types.bal` file will contain the derived entity types based on the entities defined in the model file.
`persist_test_client.bal` file will contain the client API for the entities defined in the model file for the test-datastore.
`persist_test_init.bal` file will contain the initialization of the test database schema based on the entities defined in the model file for the test-datastore.
`script.sql` file will contain the SQL script to create the database schema based on the entities defined in the model file.

The database schema will contain the code to create,
1. Tables for each entity with defined primary keys
2. Create foreign key associations between tables if the model has defined associations between entities

Apart from the `bal build` users can also use the following command to generate the same as above mentioned,

```bash
bal persist generate --datastore mysql --module db --test-datastore h2
```

| Command Parameter |                                       Description                                        | Mandatory | Default Value  |
|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:--------------:|
|    --datastore    |  used to indicate the preferred database client. Currently, 'mysql', 'mssql', 'google sheets' and 'postgresql' are supported.   |    Yes     |        |
|     --module      |      used to indicate the persist enabled module in which the files are generated.       |    No     | <package_name> |
| --test-datastore |            used to indicate the preferred database client for testing. Currently, 'h2', 'inmemory' are supported.            | No |         No         | 

Behaviour of the `generate` command,
- User should invoke the command within a Ballerina project
- The model definition file should contain the `persist` module import (`import ballerina/persist as _;`)
- The Model definition file should contain at least one entity
- If the user invokes the command twice, it will not fail. It will generate the files once again.

## 4. Push Persistence Schema to the Data Provider

>**Info:** This command is not supported yet. The SQL script generated by the `generate` command can be used to create the database schema.
> 
```bash
bal persist push
```

This command will run the schema against the database defined in  the `Ballerina.toml` file under the heading ([persist.model.storage.mysql]).
Database configuration in Ballerina.toml should look like following,
```
[persist.model.storage.mysql]
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
user = "root"
password = "Test123#"
database = "persist"
```

The file structure of the project should be similar to the following before running the command.
```
medical-center
├── generated
     ├── persist_client.bal
     ├── persist_db_config.bal
     ├── persist_types.bal
     └── script.sql
├── persist
     └── medical-center.bal
├── Ballerina.toml
├── Config.toml
└── main.bal
```

Running the database schema will create,
1. Tables for each entity with defined primary keys
2. Create foreign key associations between tables if the model has defined associations between entities

Behaviour of the `push` command,
- User should invoke the command within a Ballerina project
- User should add the relevant configuration to the Ballerina.toml file.
- The user should have initiated the persistence layer in the project and executed the `generate` command to generate the SQL script.
- If the user invokes the command twice, it will not fail. It will rerun the SQL script against the database.

## 5. Pull Persistence Schema from the Data Provider

```bash
bal persist pull --datastore mysql --host localhost --port 3306 --user root --database persist
```
| Command Parameter |                                       Description                                       | Mandatory |   Default Value    |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:------------------:|
|    --datastore    | used to indicate the preferred data store. supports `mysql`, `postgresql`, and `mssql`. |    No     |       mysql        |
|      --host       |                           used to indicate the database host                            |    Yes    |        None        |
|      --port       |                           used to indicate the database port                            |    No     | datastore specific |
|      --user       |                           used to indicate the database user                            |    Yes    |        None        |
|    --database     |                           used to indicate the database name                            |    Yes    |        None        |

This command will introspect the schema of the database and create a `model.bal` file with the entities and relations based on the schema of the database. The database configuration should be provided as command-line arguments.

This command should execute within a Ballerina project.  

The `persist` directory is created if it is not already present. If a `model.bal` file is already present in the `persist` directory, it will prompt the user to confirm overwriting the existing `model.bal` file.

Running the `pull` command will,
1. Create a `model.bal` file with the entities and relations based on the introspected schema of the database.
2. Not change the schema of the database in any way.

Behaviour of the `pull` command,
- User should invoke the command within a Ballerina project.
- User should provide the relevant database configuration as command-line arguments.
- The database password is not provided as a command-line argument. The user will be prompted to enter the password.
- If the user invokes the command while a `model.bal` file exists in the `persist` directory, it will prompt the user to confirm overwriting the existing `model.bal` file.
- If the user introspects a database with unsupported data types, it will inform the user by giving a warning and will comment out the relevant field with the tag `[Unsupported[DATA_TYPE]]`.
- The user must execute the `generate` command to generate the derived types and client API after running the `pull` command in order to use the client API in the project.

## 6. Migrate Persistence Schema to the Data Provider

```bash
bal persist migrate --datastore mysql migrationLabel
```
| Command Parameter |                                   Description                                    | Mandatory | Default Value |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
|    --datastore    | used to indicate the preferred data store. Currently, only 'mysql' is supported. |    No     |     mysql     |

This command will generate the required migration scripts based on the changes in the `model.bal` file.

This command should execute within a Ballerina project.

The file structure of the project should be similar to the following after running the command.

```
rainier
   ├── persist
         └── model.bal
         └── migrations
               └── 20240410120000_migrationLabel
                  ├── model.bal
                  └── script.sql     
   ├── Ballerina.toml
   └── main.bal
```

The `persist/migrations` directory is created if it is not already present. If the `persist/migrations` directory already contains any migrations, the tool will look at the last migration and generate the next migration script based on the last `model.bal` file that was migrated.

Running the `migrate` command will,
1. Generate a migration script based on the changes in the `model.bal` file. These can be found at `persist/migrations` directory, within another directory named in the format `[TIMESTAMP]_[migrationLabel]` where the `migrationLabel` is provided as a positional CLI argument. This directory will contain the latest `model.bal` file and the migration script.
2. Not run the migration script against the database. The user should run the migration script against the database manually after reviewing the script.

Behaviour of the `migrate` command,
- User should invoke the command within a Ballerina project.
- User should provide the migration label as a positional argument. The user also can provide the data store to the `--datastore` parameter to indicate the preferred data store. However, as only `mysql` is currently supported, it is optional and is set to `mysql` by default.
